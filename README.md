## Running Tests
Jest is the testing framework we choose. Please run the command 
```
npm install
```
to install all dependencies required for Jest. (Nick's understanding, can be wrong tho)
### Structuring Unit Tests
* for each functionality, write their tests in separate files that has the form "<functionailty_name>.test.ts". E.g. I'll create a cli.test.ts file in the test/ folder to test CLI code.
* use the following command in terminal to run your test script (I guess it might break if we have more .test.ts files in the directory tho, but we can work on that later).
```
./run test
```
* Tutorial I (Nick) followed that has a short section (with code) that tells you how to set up jest tests.
